# NeoStrategy

Neo Strategy is a tool to create an action priority matrix of tasks.

It is called NeoStrategy because we often created an action priority matrix at strategy meetings - (the strategy part). And I prefixed with "Neo", because matrix. ðŸ¤“

## Todo

- [x] Theming
- [x] Add Priorities via text field
- [x] Allow optional resources/priority fields
- [x] Tooltips on hover
- [x] Add priority item when clicking a blank space on canvas
- [x] Add a help menu
- [x] Add a screenshot tool to export the as a PNG/PDF that shows the left sidenav and all the priorities
- [x] Edit/delete priority when clicking on it on the canvas
- [ ] When pasting into the floating input box, automatically add it instead of waiting for enter or add button
- [ ] If clicking away from the floating priority and there is text entered, add the priority as if pressing the enter or add button
- [ ] If clicking away from the floating priority and there is no text entered, close the priority box and do not open a new one
- [ ] Change position of floating input tooltips so they aren't in the way
- [ ] Fix long names of priorities breaking the list
- [ ] Fix png and pdf export (if priority list is too long we cannot export easily) - maybe export should just screenshot the canvas, and not do the resulting order
- [ ] Add export final order to clipboard for pasting
- [ ] Press escape to exit out of the floating input box
- [ ] Dynamic resizing
- [x] Keep a dynamic list of priorities based on quarters

  - [x] Radius
  - [x] Standard fill colour (done by theme)
  - [x] Hover fill colour (done by theme)
  - [x] Tooltips always on
  - [ ] Hide priority text (the numbering system) (maybe if the user enters their own numbers in the priority we auto turn them off and notify the user)
  - [ ] Tooltip Background colour
  - [ ] Tooltip text colour
  - [ ] Axis Orientation
